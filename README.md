# oc-p14-hrnet 👋

This project is the n°14 of the [OpenClassrooms Front-End learning path](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react).

**WealthHealth** is a large financial company that uses an in-house employee management application: **HRnet**.
My main goal is to update HRnet and convert it to React. The old version uses 4 JQuery plugins : datetimepicker, jquery-modal, jquery-ui/selectmenu, DataTables

My tasks:

- [ ] Convert the entire project to React
- [ ] Add a state management system
- [ ] Responsive
- [ ] Export a React plugin to NPM
- [ ] Unit tests and manual tests
- [ ] Performance report between old and new version

## ✨ Interface

## 🚨 Prerequisites

To get and build the project you will need to install :

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- A terminal to run commands. If you don't have one, I would recommend to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it provides an integrated terminal inside the code editor.
- Optional : PNPM instead of NPM
- Optional : [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 🛠️ Installation

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

## 🚀 Usage

```sh
$ pnpm run dev
```
